/**
 * Start-up script for CentralNotice.
 *
 * Here's what it does:
 * - Check if we're on a Special page; quick bow-out if so.
 * - For legacy support, ensure that the centralNotice div is available, as it
 *   was in legacy code.
 * - If a banner was requested for testing, load that.
 * - Otherwise, if there are campaigns in choiceData, filter and process that,
 *   and possibly display a banner.
 *
 * This module depends on ext.centralNotice.geoIP and
 * ext.centralNotice.choiceData. If there are campaigns in choiceData,
 * that module will depend on any other modules needed for further processing.
